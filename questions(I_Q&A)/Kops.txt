question :
----------------------------
what is kubernetes KOps???

answer :
----------------------------
*->kOps is an automation tool used to setup a Kubernetes cluster instead of using kubeadmin to do it.
*->kOps is not something that will help you setup managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS) or something but if you intended to spin a test cluster or a small dev cluster then kOps can quickly do this.
*->kops will not only help you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available Kubernetes cluster, but it will also provision the necessary cloud infrastructure.
*->It support AWS, DigitalOcean, GCE, and OpenStack in beta support, and Azure and AliCloud in alpha.
