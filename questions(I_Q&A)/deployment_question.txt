You have 10 nodes with 500GB of disk attached to each node. Let us say the node disk space reached 85% usage; 
then the pod we have deployed should get evicted and re-deployed on a node with better disk health. Explain if this can even be done??????
answer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, this behavior can be achieved in Kubernetes, but it requires the right configuration and mechanisms. 
Kubernetes does not natively handle this exact scenario out of the box, but with the use of node eviction policies, taints and tolerations, 
and custom monitoring, it is possible to achieve the desired behavior.

Breaking Down the Problem
Disk Space Monitoring:
-----------------------
Kubernetes tracks the disk usage on nodes and takes action when disk resources are critically low.
By default, Kubernetes evicts pods only when a nodeâ€™s disk usage hits the critical threshold defined in kubelet settings, such as diskPressure.
85% Disk Usage Eviction:
------------------------
Kubernetes does not automatically evict pods at exactly 85% disk usage; however, you can adjust the thresholds or use custom mechanisms to implement this behavior.
Re-deploying Pods:
----------------------
Kubernetes can automatically schedule evicted pods to another node if a suitable node with enough resources is available.

Steps to Implement This Behavior
1. Configure Kubelet Disk Eviction Thresholds
-----------------------------------------------
Kubernetes uses the kubelet to monitor resource usage, including disk space. 
You can set custom eviction thresholds in the kubelet configuration.

Example Configuration:


evictionHard:
  nodefs.available: "15%"  # Evict pods when less than 15% of disk space is available
evictionSoft:
  nodefs.available: "20%"  # Start soft eviction when less than 20% is available
evictionSoftGracePeriod:
  nodefs.available: "1m"  # Wait 1 minute before enforcing the soft eviction
How It Works:

When disk usage exceeds the specified threshold (e.g., less than 15% available), the node is marked under disk pressure, and pods are evicted based on their priority and usage.
2. Use Taints and Tolerations for Disk Pressure
When a node is under disk pressure, Kubernetes can automatically taint the node, preventing further pods from being scheduled while evicting existing ones.

Example Taint (automatically added when disk pressure is detected):
------------------------------------------------------------------
key: node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure
effect: NoSchedule
Tolerations (add to pod specs to handle eviction gracefully):


tolerations:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- key: "node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

3. Monitor Disk Usage Using a Custom Solution
--------------------------------------------------
To specifically target 85% disk usage instead of relying on Kubernetes thresholds, you can:

Deploy a monitoring tool like Prometheus with Node Exporter.
Set up an alert to detect nodes with disk usage > 85%.
Use a custom script or Kubernetes operator to:
Evict pods on the affected node using the kubectl drain command.
Ensure pods are rescheduled on healthier nodes.
4. Pod Priority and Preemption
To ensure critical pods are not affected, use Pod Priority Classes. Pods with lower priority are evicted first when a node is under resource pressure.

Example Priority Class:
---------------------------------------
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 1000
  globalDefault: false
  description: "Priority for critical workloads."
Assign this priority class to critical pods so they are less likely to be evicted.

Limitations
Node Disk Space Awareness:
--------------------------------
Kubernetes doesn't directly allow scheduling decisions based on disk health or space.
You may need a custom scheduler or third-party tools like Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler to enforce such logic.
Eviction Overhead:
-------------------
Evicting pods may disrupt services unless they are stateless or highly available.
Conclusion
Yes, it is feasible to evict pods when a node reaches 85% disk usage and redeploy them to healthier nodes. The solution involves:

Configuring kubelet eviction thresholds.
Leveraging taints and tolerations for disk pressure.
Using monitoring tools like Prometheus for custom thresholds (like 85%).
Ensuring pods are rescheduled to healthier nodes with sufficient resources.
